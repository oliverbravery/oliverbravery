### [PrintGuard](https://github.com/oliverbravery/PrintGuard)
![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/oliverbravery/PrintGuard?style=for-the-badge)

PrintGuard offers local, real-time print failure detection for 3D printing on edge devices. A web interface enables users to monitor multiple printer-facing cameras, connect to printers through compatible services (i.e. Octoprint) and receive failure notifications when the computer vision fault detection model designed for local edge deployment detects an issue and automatically suspend or terminate the print job.
- Tech: Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker

### [Edge FDM Fault Detection](https://github.com/oliverbravery/Edge-FDM-Fault-Detection)
![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/oliverbravery/Edge-FDM-Fault-Detection?style=for-the-badge)

This repository contains code for training and evaluating Prototypical Networks (and fine-tuning feature extractors) as seen in the research paper "Few-shot Classification for Real-time Additive Manufacturing Fault Detection on Edge Devices" by Oliver Bravery.
- Tech: Python, PyTorch, Machine Learning, Neural Networks

### [OpenAuth](https://github.com/oliverbravery/OpenAuth)
